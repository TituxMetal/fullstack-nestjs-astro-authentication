# Product Context: Authentication System

## Why This Project Exists

Modern web applications require secure, scalable authentication systems that can grow with the
business. This project creates a foundation that demonstrates best practices in both backend
architecture and frontend user experience.

## Problems We're Solving

### Technical Problems

- **Architecture Complexity:** Many authentication systems become tightly coupled and hard to
  maintain
- **Security Concerns:** Implementing secure authentication with proper token management
- **Developer Experience:** Creating a codebase that's easy to understand, test, and extend
- **Monorepo Management:** Coordinating frontend and backend development efficiently

### User Problems

- **Friction in Authentication:** Users need seamless login/registration flows
- **Profile Management:** Users want to easily view and update their profiles
- **Security Confidence:** Users need to trust that their data is handled securely

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Landing:** User arrives at authentication page
2. **Choice:** Seamless toggle between login and registration
3. **Authentication:** Quick, secure login with immediate feedback
4. **Profile Access:** Easy access to view and edit profile information
5. **Session Management:** Transparent session handling with secure logout

### Developer Experience

- Clear separation of concerns through hexagonal architecture
- Easy to test individual components
- Simple to add new features without breaking existing functionality
- Consistent patterns across frontend and backend

## Target User Personas

### Primary: Developers

- Need a reference implementation of clean architecture
- Want to understand best practices for authentication
- Require maintainable, testable code patterns

### Secondary: End Users
