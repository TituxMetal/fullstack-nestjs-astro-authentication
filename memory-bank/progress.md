- âœ… **Issue #6 COMPLETE:** Foundation validation (validate-setup.sh script created)

### Best Practices & Automation âœ…

- âœ… **Commit Conventions:** `commitlint` and `Commitizen` integrated with Husky hooks.
- âœ… **Versioning:** `Changesets` configured for automated versioning and changelog generation.
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions workflow created for automated validation, testing,
  building, and code coverage reporting on pull requests.
- âœ… **Code Coverage:** Automated coverage summaries posted as PR comments.
- âœ… **Security Audits:** `yarn npm audit` integrated into CI (pending final local validation).

### Backend Implementation (NestJS) âœ…

- âœ… **Framework:** NestJS 11.1.2 with hexagonal architecture structure
- âœ… **Database:** Prisma ORM integration with SQLite, migrations ready
- âœ… **Architecture:** Proper domain/application/infrastructure separation
- âœ… **Configuration:** Environment variables, validation, testing setup
- âœ… **Development:** Hot reload, build system, development server (port 3000)

### Frontend Implementation (Astro) âœ…

- âœ… **Framework:** Astro 5.x with React integration
- âœ… **Styling:** Tailwind CSS V4 configured and working
- âœ… **Architecture:** Component structure, layouts, pages established
- âœ… **Development:** Development server (port 4321), hot reload working
- âœ… **Testing:** Vitest configuration ready

### Cross-Platform Integration âœ…

- âœ… **Monorepo:** Turbo build orchestration with caching
- âœ… **Types:** Shared types package (`@auth-system/shared-types`)
- âœ… **Path Aliases:** `~/*` (local) and `@auth-system/*` (cross-workspace)
- âœ… **Scripts:** `yarn dev` runs both apps simultaneously
- âœ… **Quality:** TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier working across all workspaces

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Foundation Phase âœ… COMPLETE

All foundation issues are now complete:

- âœ… **Issue #6 COMPLETE:** Foundation validation script (validate-setup.sh) created
- âœ… All environment validation, project structure, and development workflow verified
- âœ… README.md updated with validation script documentation

### Development Phase (Ready to Start)

#### Backend Domain Layer

- [ ] User entity implementation with TDD
- [ ] Value objects (Email, Password, UserRole)
- [ ] Domain services (UserService, AuthService)
- [ ] Repository interfaces (UserRepository)
- [ ] Domain events and aggregates

#### Authentication Implementation

- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] Login/logout endpoints
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] Password hashing with Argon2
- [ ] Session management with secure cookies

#### Frontend Authentication

- [ ] Login/register forms
- [ ] Protected route guards
- [ ] User session management
- [ ] Authentication state management
- [ ] Error handling and validation

## Current Status

### Development Environment âœ…

- **Node.js:** v22.15.1 with nvm configuration
- **Package Manager:** Yarn 4.9.1 with corepack
- **Build System:** Turbo monorepo with workspace management
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict, ESLint 9, Prettier configured

### Applications Status âœ…

- **Backend:** NestJS running on http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend:** Astro running on http://localhost:4321
- **Integration:** Cross-workspace imports working
- **Development:** Hot reload functioning for both applications

### Quality Assurance âœ…

- **TypeScript:** Strict compilation across all workspaces
- **Linting:** ESLint 9 with NestJS and Astro configurations
- **Formatting:** Prettier with consistent style rules
- **Testing:** Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) configured
- **Build:** Turbo orchestration with caching optimization

## Known Issues

### No Foundation Issues âœ…

- All foundation issues are complete
- Validation script created and documented
- Ready to proceed with development phase

### Architecture Considerations

- Hexagonal architecture patterns established but need domain implementation
- Authentication flow designed but requires implementation
- Frontend state management approach needs definition
- Testing strategy needs expansion beyond unit tests

## Success Metrics Achieved âœ…

### Technical Infrastructure

- âœ… **Monorepo:** Working Turbo + Yarn workspace setup
- âœ… **Frameworks:** Both NestJS and Astro fully functional
- âœ… **TypeScript:** Strict compilation and shared types working
- âœ… **Development:** Smooth development workflow with hot reload
- âœ… **Build System:** Optimized build pipeline with caching

### Development Experience

- âœ… **Environment:** Consistent Node.js/Yarn versions
- âœ… **Code Quality:** Automated linting and formatting
- âœ… **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns established
- âœ… **Integration:** Cross-workspace dependencies working
- âœ… **Scripts:** Unified development and build commands

## Next Milestones
