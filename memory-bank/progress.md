## What's Left to Build 🚧

### Foundation Phase Completion (Issue #6 OPEN)

#### Issue #6: Foundation Validation & Development Checklist (OPEN)

- [ ] Create validation script to check environment setup
- [ ] Create development checklist for daily workflow
- [ ] Validate documentation accuracy by following setup guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
- [ ] Complete milestone completion checklist

### Development Phase (Post-Foundation)

#### Backend Domain Layer

- [ ] User entity implementation with TDD
- [ ] Value objects (Email, Password, UserRole)
- [ ] Domain services (UserService, AuthService)
- [ ] Repository interfaces (UserRepository)
- [ ] Domain events and aggregates

#### Authentication Implementation

- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] Login/logout endpoints
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] Password hashing with Argon2
- [ ] Session management with secure cookies

#### Frontend Authentication

- [ ] Login/register forms
- [ ] Protected route guards
- [ ] User session management
- [ ] Authentication state management
- [ ] Error handling and validation

## Current Status

### Development Environment ✅

- **Node.js:** v22.15.1 with nvm configuration
- **Package Manager:** Yarn 4.9.1 with corepack
- **Build System:** Turbo monorepo with workspace management
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict, ESLint 9, Prettier configured

### Applications Status ✅

- **Backend:** NestJS running on http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend:** Astro running on http://localhost:4321
- **Integration:** Cross-workspace imports working
- **Development:** Hot reload functioning for both applications

### Quality Assurance ✅

- **TypeScript:** Strict compilation across all workspaces
- **Linting:** ESLint 9 with NestJS and Astro configurations
- **Formatting:** Prettier with consistent style rules
- **Testing:** Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) configured
- **Build:** Turbo orchestration with caching optimization

## Known Issues

### Foundation Completion Required

- Issue #6 must be completed before moving to development phase
- Validation scripts needed for environment consistency

### Architecture Considerations

- Hexagonal architecture patterns established but need domain implementation
- Authentication flow designed but requires implementation
- Frontend state management approach needs definition
- Testing strategy needs expansion beyond unit tests

## Success Metrics Achieved ✅

### Technical Infrastructure

- ✅ **Monorepo:** Working Turbo + Yarn workspace setup
- ✅ **Frameworks:** Both NestJS and Astro fully functional
- ✅ **TypeScript:** Strict compilation and shared types working
- ✅ **Development:** Smooth development workflow with hot reload
- ✅ **Build System:** Optimized build pipeline with caching

### Development Experience

- ✅ **Environment:** Consistent Node.js/Yarn versions
- ✅ **Code Quality:** Automated linting and formatting
- ✅ **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns established
- ✅ **Integration:** Cross-workspace dependencies working
- ✅ **Scripts:** Unified development and build commands

## Next Milestones
