- [ ] **Database Schema:** Design and implement User model with Prisma
- [ ] **Domain Layer:** Create User entity and value objects
- [ ] **Authentication Module:** Implement JWT cookie authentication
- [ ] **API Endpoints:** Create auth and user management routes

### Phase 3: Frontend Core (Following)

- [ ] **Astro Setup:** Initialize with React integration
- [ ] **Styling System:** Configure Tailwind V4
- [ ] **Authentication Pages:** Login/register hybrid interface
- [ ] **Profile Management:** User profile view and edit
- [ ] **API Integration:** Connect frontend to backend services

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Final)

- [ ] **Full Auth Flow:** End-to-end authentication testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test suite implementation
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Global error management
- [ ] **Security Hardening:** Final security review and implementation
- [ ] **Documentation:** API docs and usage guides

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Challenges

- **None identified** - Project in planning phase

### Anticipated Challenges

- **Cookie Configuration:** Ensuring secure cross-origin cookie handling
- **Hexagonal Implementation:** Maintaining proper layer separation in NestJS
- **Type Sharing:** Efficient TypeScript type sharing between apps
- **Testing Isolation:** Unit test isolation with dependency injection

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic functionality, add complexity gradually
- **Incremental Testing:** Test each layer as it's implemented
- **Documentation First:** Document decisions before implementation
- **Regular Reviews:** Check architectural compliance during development

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Requirements (Project Start)

```
✅ Backend: NestJS with hexagonal architecture
✅ Frontend: Astro with React
✅ Authentication: JWT cookies (no Passport.js)
✅ Security: Argon for password hashing
✅ Database: Prisma ORM
✅ Testing: Unit tests only
✅ Structure: Turbo monorepo
```

### Architecture Refinements

- **Hexagonal Pattern:** Chose strict domain/application/infrastructure separation
- **Module Structure:** Decided on auth and user modules with shared components
- **API Design:** Planning RESTful endpoints with clear responsibilities
- **Frontend Architecture:** Component-based with authentication context

### Technology Upgrades

- **Tailwind V4:** Latest version for improved performance
- **React Hook Form:** Modern form handling with validation
- **Zod Validation:** TypeScript-first schema validation
- **Testing Libraries:** React Testing Library + Jest combination

## Metrics & KPIs

### Code Quality Targets

- **Test Coverage:** >80% for business logic
- **Type Coverage:** 100% TypeScript coverage
- **Linting:** Zero ESLint errors
