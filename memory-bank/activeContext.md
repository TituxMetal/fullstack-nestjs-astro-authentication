# Active Context: Current Work & Decisions

## Current Work Focus

**Phase:** ðŸŽ¯ **Foundation Phase Completion - Issues #4, #5, #6**  
**Priority:** High - Issue #9 (Framework Initialization) COMPLETE, need to finish Foundation Phase  
**Current Status:** âœ… **Issue #9 COMPLETE**, ðŸš§ **Issues #4, #5, #6 OPEN** - Foundation Phase 80%
complete

## Recent Changes

- âœ… **Issue #9 COMPLETE:** Framework Initialization (NestJS + Astro) closed
- âœ… **Issue #3 COMPLETE:** TypeScript and Linting Infrastructure closed
- âœ… **Issue #2 COMPLETE:** Turbo Monorepo Structure closed
- âœ… **Issue #1 COMPLETE:** Environment Setup closed
- ðŸš§ **Issues #4, #5, #6 OPEN:** Still need completion for Foundation Phase

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Issue #4: Git Hooks & Development Workflow** (OPEN)

- Install and configure Husky
- Set up lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
- Configure pre-commit hook to run linting and formatting
- Set up pre-push hook for type checking
- Create comprehensive `.gitignore` file

### 2. **Issue #5: Project Documentation & Setup Guide** (OPEN)

- Create comprehensive `README.md`
- Document development setup instructions
- Add project structure explanation
- Include technology stack overview
- Create getting started guide

### 3. **Issue #6: Foundation Validation & Development Checklist** (OPEN)

- Create validation script to check environment setup
- Create development checklist for daily workflow
- Validate documentation accuracy by following setup guide
- Create troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
- Complete milestone validation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Current Status Based on GitHub Analysis

- **Foundation Phase:** 80% complete (4/5 foundation issues closed)
- **Framework Setup:** 100% complete (NestJS + Astro working)
- **Infrastructure:** Ready for development workflow completion

### Critical Path

1. **Complete Issues #4, #5, #6** to finish Foundation Phase
2. **Move to Development Phase** with backend domain layer implementation
3. **Authentication System Implementation** following hexagonal architecture

### Important Project Insights

#### Completed Infrastructure âœ…

- **NestJS Backend:** Hexagonal architecture, Prisma database, JWT auth ready
- **Astro Frontend:** React integration, Tailwind CSS V4, component architecture
- **TypeScript:** Shared configs, path aliases, cross-workspace imports
- **Testing:** Jest (backend) + Vitest (frontend) configured
- **Build System:** Turbo monorepo with caching, development scripts

#### Architectural Achievements âœ…

- Cross-workspace type sharing working (`@auth-system/shared-types`)
- Path aliases configured (`~/*` local, `@auth-system/*` cross-workspace)
- ESLint 9 compatibility with NestJS and Astro support
- Comprehensive build pipeline with Turbo orchestration

## Team Context

### Development Workflow Status

- **Environment:** Node.js v22.15.1 + Yarn 4.9.1 standardized
- **Monorepo:** Turbo + Yarn workspaces functioning
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier configured
- **Applications:** Both backend (port 3000) and frontend (port 4321) working

### Quality Standards Met âœ…

- All TypeScript compilation working across workspaces
- ESLint rules enforced consistently
- Prettier formatting applied uniformly
- Build system optimized with caching
- Testing infrastructure ready

## Current Blockers

### Issues Requiring Completion

1. **Issue #4:** Development workflow automation (Git hooks, pre-commit checks)
2. **Issue #5:** Project documentation (README, setup guide, architecture docs)
3. **Issue #6:** Foundation validation (validation scripts, troubleshooting guide)

### Post-Foundation Roadmap

Once Issues #4, #5, #6 are complete:

- **Backend Domain Layer:** User entities, value objects, repository interfaces
- **Authentication Flow:** Registration, login, JWT token management
- **Frontend Components:** Auth forms, protected routes, user management
- **Integration:** End-to-end authentication system testing

## Technology Context

### Backend Architecture (NestJS)

- **Pattern:** Hexagonal architecture implemented
- **Database:** Prisma ORM with SQLite, migration system ready
- **Security:** JWT cookies planned, Argon2 hashing configured
- **Testing:** Jest with comprehensive unit test structure

### Frontend Architecture (Astro)

- **Framework:** Astro 5.x with React integration
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS V4 configured
- **Architecture:** Component-based with layouts and pages
- **Testing:** Vitest configured for component testing

### Development Environment

- **Status:** Production-ready development setup
- **Scripts:** `yarn dev` runs both apps, all build commands working
- **Quality:** All linting, formatting, type checking operational
