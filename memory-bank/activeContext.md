# Active Context: Current Work & Decisions

## Current Work Focus

**Phase:** Issue #2 Complete - Ready for Issue #3  
**Priority:** High - TypeScript and Linting Configuration Setup  
**Current Branch:** feature/monorepo-structure (ready for commit)

## Recent Changes

- âœ… **Memory Bank Initialized:** Created comprehensive documentation structure
- âœ… **Architecture Decided:** Hexagonal architecture for backend, component-based for frontend
- âœ… **Tech Stack Finalized:** NestJS + Astro/React in Turbo monorepo
- âœ… **Security Approach:** JWT cookies with Argon2 hashing (no Passport.js)
- âœ… **Environment Setup:** Completed .gitignore, .nvmrc, .yarnrc.yml configuration
- âœ… **Monorepo Structure:** Completed foundational Turbo workspace setup (Issue #2)

## Next Immediate Steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Issue #2 - COMPLETED âœ…

- âœ… Create root package.json with Turbo workspace configuration
- âœ… Configure turbo.json for build orchestration and caching
- âœ… Set up directory structure (apps/, packages/)
- âœ… Create basic apps/backend scaffolding (minimal package.json)
- âœ… Create basic apps/frontend scaffolding (minimal package.json)
- âœ… Set up packages/shared-types for TypeScript interfaces
- âœ… Configure packages/eslint-config for shared linting rules
- âœ… Add development scripts and workspace commands
- âœ… Test workspace functionality

### ðŸ”¥ Next Priority: Issue #3 - TypeScript & Linting Configuration

- [ ] Configure TypeScript for each workspace (tsconfig.json files)
- [ ] Set up ESLint configurations with import/order rules
- [ ] Configure Prettier with user's style preferences
- [ ] Set up path aliases using ~ for local modules
- [ ] Test linting and type checking across workspaces

### 2. Backend Foundation (Following)

- [ ] Initialize NestJS application with hexagonal structure
- [ ] Set up Prisma with User schema
- [ ] Implement domain entities (User, Value Objects)
- [ ] Create authentication module structure

### 3. Frontend Foundation (Later)

- [ ] Initialize Astro project with React integration
- [ ] Configure Tailwind V4
- [ ] Set up basic routing structure
- [ ] Create authentication page layout

### 4. Integration Setup (Final)

- [ ] Configure CORS and cookie handling
- [ ] Set up API communication patterns
- [ ] Implement authentication context
- [ ] Test full authentication flow

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### âœ… Confirmed Decisions

- **No Passport.js:** Direct JWT implementation for learning/control
- **Cookie-based Auth:** More secure than localStorage approach
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns
- **Unit Tests Only:** No e2e tests per requirements
- **Argon2 Hashing:** Industry standard for password security

### âœ… Recently Confirmed Decisions

- **Package Manager:** Corepack yarn v4.9.1 + yarn workspaces (no npm/pnpm)
- **Database:** SQLite for both development and production
- **Testing:** Jest (backend/NestJS) + Vitest (frontend/Astro)
- **Development Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS V4 only (no PostCSS/Autoprefixer)
- **Node Version:** v22.15.1 LTS (managed with nvm)
- **API Versioning:** Keep simple for now (no versioning initially)
- **Logging:** NestJS built-in logging solution
- **Deployment:** Docker containers on personal Debian server

### âœ… Code Style & Standards Decisions

- **Path Aliases:** Use ~ (tilde) for local modules, not @ symbol
- **Import Ordering:** ESLint import/order with alphabetization
- **Code Style:** Single quotes, no semicolons, 100 char width
- **Scope Adherence:** Complete one issue at a time, avoid scope creep

### âœ… Final Implementation Decisions

- **Validation Strategy:** Application layer validation (DTOs with class-validator)
- **TDD Approach:** Inside-out TDD (domain â†’ application â†’ infrastructure)
- **Development Environment:** Native Node.js development, Docker for production only
- **Project Setup:** Complete from-scratch build for learning
- **Authentication Scope:** Basic JWT cookies initially, refresh tokens later with password reset
- **Test Database:** In-memory SQLite for unit tests

### ðŸ¤” Remaining Questions

- **Error Handling:** Global error handling strategy (to define during development)

### ðŸ’¡ Improvement Suggestions

Based on the requirements, here are recommended enhancements:

1. **API Versioning:** Implement `/api/v1/` for future compatibility
2. **Role-Based Access:** Add user roles for scalability
3. **Email Verification:** Add email confirmation for registration
4. **Password Reset:** Implement password reset functionality
5. **Rate Limiting:** Add auth endpoint protection
6. **Refresh Tokens:** Implement token refresh mechanism
7. **Audit Logging:** Track authentication events
8. **API Documentation:** Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Domain-First:** Start with domain models, then build outward
- **Interface Segregation:** Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Injection:** Consistent DI patterns throughout
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript configurations

### Testing Strategy

- **Test Pyramid:** More unit tests, fewer integration tests
- **Domain Testing:** Focus on business logic testing
- **Mock External Dependencies:** Use mocks for infrastructure
- **Fast Feedback:** Tests should run quickly

### User Experience Priorities

- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript
- **Mobile First:** Responsive design from start
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Performance:** Fast initial load times

## Project Insights & Learnings

### Architecture Benefits

- **Hexagonal Pattern:** Excellent for testability and maintainability
- **Monorepo Structure:** Simplifies shared type management
- **Cookie Authentication:** More secure than token in localStorage

### Technology Choices

- **Astro + React:** Great balance of static generation and interactivity
- **Tailwind V4:** Utility-first approach speeds development
- **Prisma:** Type-safe database operations reduce bugs
- **Turbo:** Efficient build caching and task running

### Security Considerations

- **httpOnly Cookies:** Prevents XSS attacks
- **SameSite Cookies:** CSRF protection
- **Argon2:** Resistant to timing attacks
- **Input Validation:** Multiple layers of validation

## Current Blockers & Risks

### Potential Blockers

- **None identified** - Project is in planning phase

### Risk Mitigation

- **Complexity Risk:** Start simple, add features incrementally
- **Security Risk:** Follow OWASP guidelines strictly
- **Performance Risk:** Monitor bundle sizes from start
- **Maintenance Risk:** Document architectural decisions

## Communication Notes

- User requested step-by-step planning approach
- Focus on best practices and clean architecture
- Generate comprehensive unit tests
- Open to suggestions for improvements
