# Project Brainstorming & Vision

_Document created on: 2025-07-22_ _Facilitator: Analyst Agent_

## 1. Core Project Vision

The project is a **"Production-Ready Authentication Starter Kit."**

Its primary purpose is to eliminate the repetitive, time-consuming, and error-prone setup work
required for building secure authentication in new web projects. This allows the developer to
accelerate directly to building unique, value-adding features.

## 2. The Problem We Are Solving

We are solving the **"new project setup tax."** This refers to the hours or even days of work needed
to implement a robust and modern authentication system from scratch.

This starter kit specifically aims to eliminate the following frustrations:

- Repetitive database schema setup.
- Re-writing core login/registration logic.
- Correctly configuring secure session management (e.g., cookies).
- Building high-quality, reusable UI forms.
- Implementing complex flows like "Forgot Password."
- Integrating social authentication providers.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary User:** A professional developer who values best practices (such as Clean Architecture
  and DDD), and wants a high-quality, reliable foundation to accelerate their own project
  development.
- **Secondary User:** The open-source community. The project should be well-documented and serve as
  a learning resource for others, potentially encouraging community contributions.

## 4. Project Goals & Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal (Product):** To build a fully functional, secure, and production-ready
  authentication starter kit.
- **Primary Goal (Learning):** To build the project in a way that empowers the lead developer to
  achieve mastery and deep confidence in Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.
- **Key Success Metric:** The lead developer's self-assessed expertise and confidence in applying
  these architectural patterns to future projects. The starter kit's quality and functionality will
  be a direct reflection of this mastery.

## 5. Phased Feature Roadmap

### Version 1.0: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The non-negotiable essentials for the starter kit to be immediately valuable.

- **[BE] Core Database Schema:** A `User` model with necessary fields, managed by Prisma migrations.
- **[BE] Secure Authentication Logic:** Backend services for user registration and login, following
  Clean Architecture principles.
- **[BE] Secure Session Management:** A robust system using JWTs stored in secure, httpOnly cookies.
- **[FE] Reusable UI Forms:** Polished, accessible, and reusable React components for login and
  registration forms.

### Version 1.1: High-Value Enhancements (Fast Follow)

High-value features to be added shortly after the MVP is complete.

- **[FE/BE] "Forgot Password" Flow:** A complete, secure flow for users to reset their passwords via
  email.
- **[FE/BE] Social Authentication:** An extensible module to allow login/registration via
  third-party providers, starting with GitHub.
