# PRD: Production-Ready Authentication Starter Kit (v1.0)

_This document is derived from `docs/brainstorming-output.md` and defines the scope for the v1.0
MVP._

## 1. Project Vision & MVP Goal

- **Vision:** To create a "Production-Ready Authentication Starter Kit" that eliminates the
  repetitive setup tax for new web projects.
- **v1.0 Goal:** To deliver the core, non-negotiable features that make the starter kit immediately
  valuable. This includes a secure backend API and a polished, functional set of frontend UI
  components for user authentication.

## 2. MVP Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements (FR)

- **FR1:** The system must allow new users to register with an email and a password.
- **FR2:** The system must allow existing users to log in with their email and password.
- **FR3:** The system must securely hash and store user passwords.
- **FR4:** Upon successful login, the system must issue a secure, httpOnly JWT cookie to manage the
  user's session.
- **FR5:** The system must provide a mechanism for the frontend to know if a user is currently
  authenticated.
- **FR6:** The system must provide a mechanism to log a user out, invalidating their session.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

- **NFR1:** The backend codebase must follow Clean Architecture principles to serve as a clear and
  educational example.
- **NFR2:** The frontend and backend must have clear, separated responsibilities.
- **NFR3:** All code must be written in TypeScript with `strict` mode enabled.
- **NFR4:** The project must be well-documented, explaining both how to use the starter kit and the
  architectural decisions behind it.

## 3. Epic & Story Structure for v1.0

The v1.0 MVP will be built across two primary epics, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

---

### **Epic 1: [BE] Secure Backend Implementation**

**Goal:** To build the complete backend API for user authentication, providing a robust and secure
foundation.

**Stories:**

- **Story 1.1: [BE] Implement User Domain & Core Logic:**
  - Create the `User` domain entity, value objects, and repository interface.
  - Implement the core `AuthService` with logic for registration and login, including password
    hashing.
  - _Learning Focus: Establishing a framework-agnostic domain model._
- **Story 1.2: [BE] Implement Database Persistence:**
  - Create the Prisma schema for the `User` model.
  - Implement the `UserRepository` to connect the domain logic to the database via a `UserMapper`.
  - _Learning Focus: Isolating infrastructure concerns from the core application._
- **Story 1.3: [BE] Implement API Endpoints & Session Management:**
  - Create the NestJS controllers and DTOs for the `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`,
    and `/auth/me` (session status) endpoints.
  - Implement the secure JWT cookie strategy.
  - _Learning Focus: Connecting the application core to the web via adapters._

---

### **Epic 2: [FE] Polished Frontend Implementation**

**Goal:** To build a set of polished, reusable, and accessible frontend components for user
authentication.

**Stories:**

- **Story 2.1: [FE] Design System & Component Scaffolding:**
  - Set up the basic design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) in Tailwind CSS.
  - Create a common, reusable `Button` and `Input` component.
  - _Learning Focus: Establishing a consistent and reusable UI foundation._
- **Story 2.2: [FE] Implement Authentication Forms:**
  - Create the React components for the `LoginForm` and `RegistrationForm`.
  - Include client-side validation for inputs.
  - _Learning Focus: Building controlled forms and managing local component state._
- **Story 2.3: [FE] Implement Authentication Page & API Client:**
  - Create the main `AuthPage` that allows users to toggle between the login and registration forms.
  - Create a simple, clean API client service to handle communication with the backend.
  - _Learning Focus: Managing page-level state and abstracting data fetching._
- **Story 2.4: [FE] Implement Auth State & Protected Routes:**
  - Create a global state management solution (e.g., React Context) to track the user's
    authentication status.
  - Implement a `ProtectedRoute` component that redirects unauthenticated users.
  - _Learning Focus: Managing global application state and client-side routing._
